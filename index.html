				<h1 class="center-align">We Can Be Heroes</h1>
				<p>Genuine gun reform can happen, because it has happened; we need only look abroad to see that it's possible. Despite all the money and the political pressure and the vitriol and the stalled-out seeming hopelessness of the gun debate in the US, we can get this done, because we have to. Before you imagine yourself as nothing more than a bug smashed into the gun lobby's windshield, realize that you are far from alone.</p>

				<h1 class="center-align">The Arctic Is Melting Down and so is the Food Chain</h1>
				<p>Arctic sea ice levels are at record lows for this time of year, northern Greenland saw temperatures 63 degrees Fahrenheit above average for February, and the Antarctic food chain is vanishing.

				<h1 class="center-align">Teachers With Handguns Are No Match for Assault Rifles: Why the Trump-NRA Plan Doesn't Work</h1>
				<p>After the latest gun massacre, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and throughout the country, are leading a movement that might finally loosen the National Rifle Association's (NRA) chokehold on our government. But to get there, they will have to triumph over an increasingly irrational and inhumane gun lobby, their mercenaries in Congress and the reality-disconnected White House.</p>
